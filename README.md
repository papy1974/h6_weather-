# Objective and Description. 



The purpose of this project is to allow the user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. first, when a user searches for a city,
the user will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. next, the user will see current weather conditions for that city, and the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. also, the user will view the UV index that will be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. besides, after viewed the future weather conditions for that city, the user will be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. furthermore, the user will click on a city in the search history and again be presented with current and future conditions for that city. In the end, after the user opened the weather dashboard, the user will be presented with the last searched city forecast. from this project, I learned that I can use jquery code, CSS, Html, API key to build a weather dashboard. I build a weather dashboard application to allowed any person to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.
